# BedJet
openscad bedjet air hose 

This is a set of scad files which generates the pieces needed for a rigid airhose
for a bedjet.

The intended order of the parts, once printed is:
inlet -> circleToOval -> pipe -> coupler -> pipe -> elbow -> pipe -> outlet

Adjust the lenth of the pipes in order to fit your mattress.
If you don't need the extra length between circleToOval and elbow, remove
one pipe and the coupler.
